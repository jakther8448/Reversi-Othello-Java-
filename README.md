# Reversi-Othello-Java-
Java-based Reversi (Othello) game implementing custom Controller and GUI View components using Swing

This project implements the **Controller** and **GUI View** components for a modular Reversi (Othello) game written in **Java Swing**.  
It was originally developed as part of my *Object-Oriented Programming (COMP1009)* module during my first year at university (graded and completed in April 2025).  
All code here represents my individual implementation â€” the design framework was provided, but all logic, event handling, and UI development were independently written.

## Project Overview
The goal of this coursework was to design and implement the **interactive and logical layers** of a Reversi (Othello) game that integrate with an existing model framework.  
The project demonstrates my ability to **read and extend existing codebases**, implement **event-driven systems**, and apply **object-oriented principles** in practice.

## Features
- **Dual-perspective GUI** with rotated views for both players  
- **Move validation** and **piece-flipping logic** across 8 directions  
- **Greedy AI opponent** for automated moves  
- **Restart functionality** and **real-time feedback messages**  
- Integration with professor-provided `IModel` interface (MVC framework)

## Techn Used
- **Java Swing** (for GUI and event handling)  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
- **Event-driven programming**  
- **Algorithmic design** (AI and rule validation)

## ðŸ“˜ What I Learned
- How to **extend and integrate code** within an existing architecture (MVC).  
- Writing **modular, testable Java code** following OOP conventions.  
- Handling **real-time game logic and GUI updates** using event-driven design.  
- Implementing simple **AI logic** (Greedy algorithm) for autonomous play.  

## ðŸ§¾ Notes
- This project was graded in May 2025 and is now released publicly as a personal portfolio project.  
- All code within this repository is my own work. The original university framework (interfaces and starter code) has not been uploaded to comply with academic integrity policies.
